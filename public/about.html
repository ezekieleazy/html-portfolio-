<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a frontend developer focused on building web interfaces that feel clear, fast, and reliable for real people. I care about how a site behaves in everyday use, not just how it looks in a mockup. My work starts with understanding the user’s goal and removing anything that gets in the way.
</p>

<p>I recently led a rebuild of an existing website using Angular and TypeScript. The original product was hard to navigate and slow to adapt across devices. I restructured components, simplified state management, and tightened performance across key pages. After launch, overall traffic increased by 40%, driven by longer sessions and better mobile engagement.
</p>

<p>Accessibility is a core part of how I work, not an afterthought. I improved keyboard navigation, color contrast, and screen reader support across the site. These changes opened the product to roughly 10% more users who were previously blocked by usability barriers. </p>

<p>I collaborate closely with designers and backend teams, translating requirements into clean, maintainable code. I value clarity in both interfaces and codebases. My goal is to ship work that is easy to use, easy to maintain, and resilient as products grow. I build with care, test thoroughly, and learn continuously from feedback. </p>
